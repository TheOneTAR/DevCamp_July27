ANGRY DICE â€“ An assignment in patience.
---------------------------------------------
Create a new module called 'angry_dice.py'.In this module, create a program that lets a 
Single Player play Angry Dice.

When the game starts, it should display:
--------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Angry Dice! Roll the two dice until you get thru the 3 Stages!
Stage 1 you need to roll 1 & 2
Stage 2 you need to roll ANGRY & 4
Stage 3 you need to roll 5 & 6
You can lock a die needed for your current stage 
and just roll the other one, but beware!
If you ever get 2 ANGRY's at once, you have to restart to Stage 1!
Also, you can never lock a 6! That's cheating!

To roll the dice, simply input the name of the die you want to roll. 
Their names are a and b.

Press ENTER to start!
--------------------------------------------------

Within the program, there should be 2 dice, made with your Die class. They should have the sides:
   ["1","2","ANGRY","4","5","6"]
and be named 'a' and 'b'.

Once the game starts, you should present your user with their initial roll in the display format:
--------------------------------------------------
You rolled:
   a = [  5  ]
   b = [  ANGRY  ]

You are in Stage 2
Roll dice:
--------------------------------------------------
The if the characters 'a' and/or 'b' are input, as part of ANY string, the program should roll the corresponding dice.

If a die has a currentValue of 6 and isn't rolled, the program should tell the user they're cheating and not enable them to win until the 6 is rerolled.
--------------------------------------------------
You're cheating! You cannot lock a 6! You cannot win
until you reroll it!
You rolled:
   a = [  6  ]
   b = [  ANGRY  ]

You are in Stage 3
Roll dice:
--------------------------------------------------
The game should automagically progress them through the 3 stages and determine when they win. It should also reset them back to Stage1 if they roll two ANGRY dice.

When the user gets 2 Angry Dice, the game should display:
--------------------------------------------------
WOW, you're ANGRY!
Time to go back to Stage 1!
--------------------------------------------------

When the user wins, the program should display:
--------------------------------------------------
You've won! Calm down!
--------------------------------------------------
